# VideoTrimmer
A tool for trimming and compressing clips, designed for use with Discord due to its restrictive file size limit of 8MB.  This program will allow users to specify a start and end duration, then automatically calculate the required bitrate to maintain the 8MB file limit, before performing the clip trimming with ffmpeg.

.NET Framework 4.7.2 is required, as Windows Forms in .NET Core does not natively support Video Players.
